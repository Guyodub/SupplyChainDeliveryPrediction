# Supply Chain Delivery Prediction Project

This Project is aimed at predicting delivery of goods in  USAID's supply chain.

Delays in deliveries of goods by USAID can have very negative impacts as some of the goods they deliver are very critical. It can cause loss of life and also make cost of good storage to increase. 

Under this project, we intend to deliver a solution based on machine learning. Predict if a delivery will delay or not.
