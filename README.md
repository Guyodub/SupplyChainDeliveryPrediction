# Supply Chain Delivery Prediction Project

This Project is aimed at predicting delivery of USAID's supply chain delivery.

Delayed in deliveries of goods by USAID can have very negative impacts as some of the goods they deliver are very critical. It can cause loss of life and also make cost of goos storage to increase. 

Under this project, we intend to deliver a solution based on machine learning. Predict if a delivery will delay or not.
